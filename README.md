# Introduction
SIRIUS (_<ins>S</ins>ystematische <ins>I</ins>dentifikation <ins>R</ins>edundanter, <ins>I</ins>dentisch <ins>U</ins>ebersetzter <ins>S</ins>equenzen_) is a synthetic biology tool leveraging Google OR-Tools integer programming to design genetic sequences with the shortest and fewest possible homologous fragments between pairs within minutes.

- Design _n_ gene sequences all translating to a given protein _P_
- Effectively synthesize sequences with maximal, optimal divergence
- Written in pure C++

**Overview of the SIRIUS workflow.** **Step (1)** The input to SIRIUS is a protein sequence of interest _P_ and the desired number _n_ of synonymous DNA sequences to be designed; **Step (2)** SIRIUS solves an integer linear program with the objective function shown here, and millions of variables and constraints; below the objective function we illustrate the codon choices for each amino acid in the example peptide _P_ from Step 1; **Step (3)** SIRIUS produces of _n_ synonymous DNA sequences that encode _P_ with the fewest and shortest common subsequences; the light blue highlights indicate homologous subsequences between any pair.
